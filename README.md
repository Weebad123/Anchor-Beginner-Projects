# Simple SOLANA STAKING PROGRAM

This project is written solely using the Anchor Framework

1. This is just a beginner-friendly project with no much functionality. You can check out the program's architecture in the Layout.md file

2. In Production-ready projects, the Reward tokens would be different from the Staking Tokens.
   However, for simplicity and this project being beginner-friendly,
   I use native SOL as both the Staking Token and Reward Token.

3. Some concepts are explained in the code comments for better understanding and clarification to newbie SOLANA developers
   who intend to write SOLANA programs using the Anchor Framework

# FUTURE IDEAS

1. I intend to write as many beginner-friendly projects encompassing a whole lot of ideas
   geared towards enabling newbie developers grasp SOLANA DEVELOPMENT easily

2. In the future, i will move to writing a little advance ANCHOR projects to help intermediate
   developers in their SOLANA DEVELOPMENT journey

3. We'll progress to writing pretty much advanced ANCHOR PROJECTS to cater for the needs of
   Advanced Developers, and act as a guide for them.

# CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions are pretty much welcomed. Newbie developers too can use this as a guide in writing SOLANA programs
using the Anchor Framework.
